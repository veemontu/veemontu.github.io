    <h1>How Eminem's Asia Tour Went</h1>
      <p>On August 17, 2019 - Eminem's Asia Tour has <em>ended</em>. Marshall gave 11 concerts in 9 countries - despite the very different mentality, there were quite a lot of people who wanted to see the artist live. Because of this, the rapper had to give two concerts in Turkey and China, which totaled 164 000 people.</p>
      <p>The artist has also held concerts in:<br/>
Jerusalem, Israel - 59 000.<br/>
Tokyo, Japan - 87 000.<br/>
Seoul, South Korea - 94 000.<br/>
Bangkok, Thailand - 21 000.<br/>
Singapore - 14 000.<br/>
Manila, Philippines - 26 000.<br/>
Jakarta, Indonesia - 32 000.</p>
      <p>For the entire tour, Eminem totaled <b>497 000</b> people.</p>
    <h3>Impressions from Native Asian Fans </h3>
      <p>A few days after the tour, namely on August 21, 2019 - the musician posted on his Instagram with the following words:<q>Thank you so much to everyone who came! You really surprised me this time, Asia! See you soon!</q/></p>
      <p>It probably won't come as an ambush to anyone that most of the people on this tour are tourists. But we spotted a couple of natives of Japan and Israel, and here are their impressions of the concerts:</p>
      <p><q>Hello! My name is Honoka, I'm 19 years old, and I am from Tokyo. I am absolutely happy that I was able to attend this concert! I have been listening to Eminem for a long time, his lyrics helped me a lot in learning English. I was really excited to see him live!</q></p>
      <p><q>Hi! My name is Aaron, I am 27 years old. I lived in Israel until I was 18 years old, and then I went to study design in Switzerland, that's where I met Eminem! My roommate really liked to listen to him every morning, he said it was easier for him to tune in to his studies, and over time I got into his music too. I really enjoyed the concert, there were a lot of people, this crazy energy! It was awesome!!</q></p>
